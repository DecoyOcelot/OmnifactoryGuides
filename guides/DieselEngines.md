# How GTCE Multiblock Diesel Engines work

They produce power and consume fuel(refer to the pinned post for a list of valid ones), lubricant(very tiny amounts) and (optionally) oxygen.

They normally produce 2048 EU/t, consuming as much fuel as needed for it. To know the amount, find the JEI page in the diesel generator tab for the fuel in question. Hover over the fuel to get the amount per "recipe" execution, then divide the total EU by that amount to get the fuel's energy density in EU/mb. 

When boosted with oxygen, they produce **three times as 
much power while only consuming double the fuel**, therefore generating 50% extra energy per unit of fuel. It is therefore advised to always oxygen-boost your diesel generators. It requires very little oxygen(about 1mb per 128mb of cetane-boosted diesel).
