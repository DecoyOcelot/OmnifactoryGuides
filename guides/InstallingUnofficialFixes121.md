Made for Omnifactory **1.2.1** specifically. **Don't** try to apply it to later versions!

# Installing Unofficial Fixes for Omnifactory 1.2.1

## Introduction

This guide covers the installation of most unofficial fixes for the 1.2.1 version of Omnifactory. Mainly, that's **Exa's fixes**, which are included in the pack itself post-1.2.1. However, there are also many fixes in the form of custom jars, which will not be integrated in the pack in the nearby future, due to Curseforge's review process.

## Steps

This guides assumes you already have 1.2.1 Omnifactory installed. [Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/omnifactory/files/2733453).

### Exa's fixes
Download them from [here](files/UnofficialFixes/Exa_Fixes_20191004.zip), or from a pinned message in #general on the pack's discord server. Follow the README inside the zip for instructions. 

TODO: make a *really* detailed installation guide, with steps and pictures.
