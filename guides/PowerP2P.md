# Power P2P Tunnel Guide
Power P2P is currently the only way to transmit arbitrary power amounts interdimensionally (using a Quantum Bridge), and is useful even inside your base. P2P tunnels are 1-input-to-N-outputs.

In order to transfer power through an AE2 P2P tunnel:
1. Put one P2P tunnel on your capacitorbank or whatever input end you want.
2. Connect it to the ME network.
3. Wrench it with a Crescent Hammer to make it turn to FE (this is why only the ME type is craftable - it can turn into the other types).
4. **Shift**+rightclick with a memory card to copy settings to the card. **Never overwrite this card** - you will configure all your power P2P's with it.

These 4 steps you only do once per input tunnel. To connect a new output to your input:
1. Slap the tunnel on your CEF or whatever.
2. Connect it to the ME network.
3. Wrench it with a Crescent Hammer to make it turn to FE 
5. Rightclick (no shift!) the tunnel with the card you configured to bind it to the same channel.

That's it. Infinite* energy transfer, with only a 5% tax**.

\*The transfer is limited by what your input can transmit through a single face, basically. For big vibrant bank multiblocks, it can easily be a million RF/t or much more.

\**The tax is drained from the AE's power, and the acceptors only take in energy every few seconds - so **you'll need a bunch of dense energy cells** to transfer all your power this way.
